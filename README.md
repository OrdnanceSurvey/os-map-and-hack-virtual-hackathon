![OS Map & Hack, virtual hackathon](os-map-and-hack-logo.png)

## Purpose
We are looking at the use of geospatial data and how this can be used as we move towards sustainable alternatives across multiple market sectors. Spatial data is key to unlocking insights that determine how we are literally shaping our world. As the pace of technological innovation quickens, implementing the infrastructure and driving interest is crucial to widespread adoption across the country at a national, organisational, and individual level.

During a two-day virtual hackathon, we are looking for examples and concepts that accelerates our journey towards a sustainable future as we provide extended, on-demand access to all our premium datasets and our team of GIS specialists.

Across four different challenges, ranging from supporting local governments to influencing consumer behaviours, a panel of innovation and geospatial experts will be evaluating your contribution and looking for the strongest and innovative examples, which make best use of OS data and APIs.

## Essentials
To join our hackathon, we have specified that you must;
- Bring your own laptop and charger.
- Have the appropriate coding software installed.
-

## Data
For the challenges in the hackathon, we will be making use of the following data:

|Name|URL|
|---|---|
|OS Data Hub|https://osdatahub.os.uk/|
|OS OpenData Downloads|https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open|
|National Chargepoint Registry (NCR)|https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-and-use-data-on-public-electric-vehicle-chargepoints|
|Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (OZEV) Statistics|https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-statistics|

## Additional information
To use the Data Hub APIs you will require a valid project key with an OS OpenData or Premium Plan.

If you have not already done so, please [sign up to the Data Hub and acquire a project API key](https://osdatahub.os.uk/plans) (**our advice for the hackathon would be to use the Premium Plan**).

The OS OpenData Plan is free to use for any purpose, including for services from which you make a profit.

Our Premium Plan gives you access to our premium data, which is our most detailed mapping and geospatial feature data. You get up to £1,000 worth of data free every month with no obligation to input payment details.

You can however get unlimited free Premium data for projects in development mode. Projects in development mode are not charged for accessing premium data, but are subjected to a 50 transactions-per-minute throttle. You can find out more about putting projects into development mode in the [Data Hub FAQs](https://osdatahub.os.uk/support/plans#developmentLiveModes).

## Challenges
You/your team can focus on one challenge, or even all four of them if you're feeling particularly inventive. Whatever your choice, be sure to have a desire to build, collaborate, and innovate.

We have produced a set of challenges to start off your explorations in the hackathon. Though this is not an exhaustive list and you are welcome to add your own. The challenges include:

[Levelling up](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/developers/hackathon/mobility-challenge) - How can local governments use geospatial data for the transition to EV's in remote communities?

[Taking charge](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/developers/hackathon/accessibility-challenge) - What is the demand for charge points of electric fleets and where do these charge points needs to be developed?

[The 'real' EV journey](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/developers/hackathon/ev-journey-challenge) - How can we build the infrastructure to accurately reflect the new habits of everyday EV users?

[Open innovation](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/developers/hackathon/open-innovation-challenge) - The open innovation challenge gives you the freedom to design and build your own sustainable concept.

## Licencing
Our Data Exploration Licence (DEL) can be seen [here](os-map-and-hack-data-exploration-licence.pdf).

## Coding advice
There will be multiple members of the OS team available to provide you with advice on the day. But for beginners, the following resources will act as a great starting point:

[OS API Examples](https://labs.os.uk/public/os-data-hub-examples/) - Here you'll find examples of our APIs in use. You can copy and paste the code to start building your own innovative projects.

[OS API Tutorials](https://labs.os.uk/public/os-data-hub-tutorials/) - Here you'll find out how we develop solutions with our APIs. You can follow our step-by-step guides to start building your own innovative projects.

You can also find a variety of OS Data Hub (+ other API) resources [here](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/os-api-resources).

## After the hack
- During the conference following our hackathon, we have set aside a 15 minute section for talks. In this, you will have the opportunity to do a short 2-3 minute 'lightning talk' to our conference attendees.
Please let us know if you are keen to do this as we would love to hear the interesting ways you have been tackling the challenges.
- There will be opportunity for some participants to present back to the policy team. We will ask participants to let us know if they are interested in this during the hackathon's closing session.
